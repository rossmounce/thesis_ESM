Abstract = {{A parsimony algorithm was used to evaluate the distribution and
   co-occurrence of 46 vascular salt marsh-associated species in 20 coastal
   salt marshes from Biscayne Bay National Park, FL, to Sable Island Marine
   Protected Sanctuary, NS, Canada. The method considers each salt marsh as
   if it were a taxon, and the presence or absence of a particular vascular
   plant species as a ``character state{''} of that taxon. Using this
   information, a 20 x 46 data matrix was created and examined by
   multivariate ordination techniques and by parsimony analysis using the
   program WinClada running over NONA. A hierarchical clustering showed
   that the salt marsh sites on the eastern seaboard of North America
   formed two main clusters, one including all of the Florida sites and
   South Carolina, and the second including all of the more northern sites:
   North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, New York, and Sable Island, NS,
   Canada. Within the large southern cluster, we find two major
   sub-clusters separating the Florida marshes from those of South
   Carolina. Likewise, within the large northern cluster, we find two major
   sub-clusters separating North Carolina and Virginia from the other
   northern marshes. An essentially similar pattern of site grouping was
   also observed using the ordination technique of non-metric
   multidimensional scaling, in which the southern marshes all aligned to
   the left of the origin, while the more northern marshes align to its
   right. Parsimony analysis yielded twelve equally parsimonious trees from
   which a strict consensus tree was constructed. The topology of the
   consensus tree clearly shows two major clades, a southern one and a
   northern one, with the division occurring between South and North
   Carolina. The main southern clade is supported by the presence of
   Sporobolus virginicus (Seashore Dropseed), while the main northern clade
   is supported by the presence of Ruppia maritima (Widgeongrass). Spartina
   alterniflora (Smooth or Atlantic Cordgrass), which we take as the single
   species that defines the salt marsh on the eastern coast of North
   America, was present in all of the sampled sites except Biscayne Bay
   National Park, FL, a mangrove swamp.}},

   nov., is described based on 14 skeletons of late Paleocene-early Eocene
   age preserved on drill core slabs from the Cherkassy Region, central

   of characters: dorsal process of premaxilla posteriorly elongate and
   overlaps frontal; maxilla greatly reduced in size; parietal squamosal
   contact absent; vomerine tooth row long and parallel to maxillary
   arcade; pterygoid has long anterior process; quadrate ossified; marginal

   a subcentral keel, anterior basapophysis, and spinal nerve foramina;
   ribs bicipital; carpals and tarsals unossified; and phalangeal formulae
   of 2-2-3-2 and 2-2-3-4-2 for manus and pes, respectively. Phylogenetic
   analysis nests S. boltyschkensis within Urodela (i.e., crown-clade

Abstract = {{Comparative leaf anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of 11 species of
   Laeliinae with emphasis on Brassavola (Orchidaceae). Brassavola inhabits
   a wide altitude range and habitat types from Northern Mexico to Northern
   Argentina. Classification schemes in plants have normally used
   vegetative and floral characters, but when species are very similar, as
   in this genus, conflicts arise in species delimitation, and alternative
   methods should be applied. In this study we explored the taxonomic and
   phylogenetic value of the anatomical structure of leaves in Brassavola;
   as ingroup, seven species of Brassavola were considered, and as an
   outgroup Guarianthe skinneri, Laelia anceps, Rhyncholaelia digbyana and
   Rhyncholaelia glauca were evaluated. Leaf anatomical characters were
   studied in freehand cross sections of the middle portion with a light
   microscope. Ten vegetative anatomical characters were selected and coded
   for the phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic reconstruction was carried
   out under maximum parsimony using the program NONA through WinClada.
   Overall, Brassavola species reveal a wide variety of anatomical
   characters, many of them associated with xeromorphic plants: thick
   cuticle, hypodermis and cells of the mesophyll with spiral thickenings
   in the secondary wall. Moreover, mesophyll is either homogeneous or
   heterogeneous, often with extravascular bundles of fibers near the
   epidermis at both terete and flat leaves. All vascular bundles are
   collateral, arranged in more than one row in the mesophyll. The
   phylogenetic analysis did not resolve internal relationships of the
   genus; we obtained a polytomy. indicating that the anatomical characters
   by themselves have little phylogenetic value in Brassavola. We concluded
   that few anatomical characters are phylogenetically important; however,
   they would provide more support to elucidate the phylogenetic
   relantionships in the Orchidaceae and other plant groups if they are
   used in conjunction with morphological and/or molecular characters. Rev.

Abstract = {{The Taeniodonta is a group of eutherian mammals from the Paleogene of
   North America, which evolved rapidly in the Paleocene to achieve, in
   some forms, large body size, hypselodont (i.e., evergrowing) canine and
   postcanine teeth, and peculiar patterns of tooth wear. Eleven genera of
   taeniodonts occur in two subgroups, recognized at the level of families
   or subfamilies depending on author, the Conoryctidae and the
   Stylinodontidae. There has not been a comprehensive computer-assisted
   phylogenetic analysis of the taeniodonts, and questions have arisen over
   the monophyly of the taeniodonts and the conoryctids. Cladistic analyses
   based on thirty-seven dental characters using NONA and Winclada showed
   that two subclades of Taeniodonta are well supported, a clade consisting
   of the conoryctids exclusive of Onychodectes (i.e., Conoryctella,
   Conoryctes, and Huerfanodon) and a clade consisting of all the known
   stylinodontids (Wortmania, Schochia, Psittacotherium, Ectoganus, and
   Stylinodon). Stratocladistic analysis, which takes into account the
   temporal sequence of taxa in the fossil record, supports the results of
   the morphological analysis. The Late Cretaceous taeniodont Schowalteria
   occupies the most basal position in taeniodont phylogeny, pre-dating an
   inferred conoryctid-stylinodontid split in the early Paleocene, and
   establishing the taeniodonts as monophyletic.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   We analysed the distributional patterns of six terrestrial vertebrate
   taxa from the Oaxacan Highlands (Sierra Mazateca, Nudo de Zempoaltepetl
   and Sierra de Juarez) through a cladistic biogeographical approach, in
   order to test their naturalness as a biotic unit.
   Location
   The Oaxacan Highlands, Mexico.
   Methods
   The cladistic biogeographical analysis was based on the area cladograms
   of the Pseudoeurycea bellii species group (Amphibia: Plethodontidae),
   the genus Chlorospingus (Aves: Thraupidae), the genera Microtus,
   Reithrodontomys and Habromys, and the Peromyscus aztecus species group
   (Mammalia: Rodentia). We obtained paralogy-free subtrees, from which the
   components were coded in a data matrix for parsimony analysis. The data
   matrix was analysed with Nona through WinClada.
   Results
   The parsimony analysis resulted in a single general area cladogram in
   which areas were fragmented following the sequence Sierra Madre
   Occidental, Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Chiapas, Sierra Madre Oriental
   + Sierra Mazateca, Sierra Madre del Sur, Nudo de Zempoaltepetl and
   Sierra de Juarez.
   Main conclusions
   The general area cladogram shows that the Oaxacan Highlands do not
   constitute a natural unit. The Sierra Mazateca is the sister area to the
   Sierra Madre Oriental, whereas the Nudo de Zempoaltepetl and the Sierra
   de Juarez are closely related to the Sierra Madre del Sur. The events
   that might have caused these patterns include cycles of expansion and
   contraction of mountain pinyon, juniper and oak woodlands during the
   Pleistocene.}},

   Methods Distributional data for 22 fish species, 34 crab species of the

   close to the Tropical Mesoamerican generalized track. Generalized tracks
   above 1000 m, including freshwater crabs, have a stronger affinity with

   Anamorphinae, Pleganophorinae, Xenomycetinae, Endomychinae,
   Stenotarsinae and Epipocinae), and 4 outgroup taxa representing 3
   families of Cucujoidea: Coccinellidae (Sticholotis and Rhyzobius),
   Corylophidae (Holopsis) and Cerylonidae (Hypodacnella). Combined matrix
   was prepared in two variants; first included all 69 taxa and 96
   morphological, adult plus larval characters, and the second variant
   included 33 taxa (only those with known larvae) coded for 96
   morphological, adult and larval characters. The shortest, most
   parsimonious solutions were investigated using NONA-WinClada and
   Hennig86. The monophyly of the largest subfamily Lycoperdininae was
   supported and based on the results of the analyses five generic groups
   may be recognized: Daulis-group, Amphix-group, Amphisternus-group,
   Eumorphus-group - monophyletic and Lycoperdina-group not supported by
   apomorphic characters. All 38 genera of Lycoperdininae are described,
   diagnosed and included in an identification key; the larvae of 10 genera
   are also described. The first larval descriptions are given for:
   Amphisternus verrucosus Gorham, Acinaces sp., Amphix vestitus cinctus
   (Fabricius), Encymon immaculatus (Montruzier). Gerstaeckerus nom. nov.
   is proposed here for Engonius Gerstaecker, 1857 (nec Engonius Perty,
   1833). Type species are designated for the following genera: Dioedes
   Gerstaecker, 1857 (Dioedes columbinus Gerstaecker, 1857), Eumorphoides
   Guerin, 1858 (Eumorphus tetraspilotus Hope, 1832), Enaisimus Guerin,
   1858 (Eumorphus quadrinotatus Gerstaecker, 1857), Haplomorphus Guerin,
   1858 (Eumorphus bipunctatus Perty, 1831), Heterandrus Guerin, 1858
   (Eumorphus confusus Guerin, 1857), Rhachidophorus Guerin, 1857
   (Cacodaemon hopei Thomson, 1857 (=Eumorphus hopei Guerin, 1857)), Olenus
   Thomson, 1857 (Trycherus senegalensis Gerstaecker, 1857). Daulis
   Erichson and Daulotypus Lea, treated in the recent classification of
   Endomychidae (Tomaszewska 2000) as genera incertae sedis, are confirmed
   here to belong in Lycoperdininae. The following new synonym is proposed:
   Evolocera championi Sharp, 1891 (=Adamia mexicana Tomaszewska, 2000),
   consequently Evolocera Sharp, previously classified in Merophysiinae, is
   moved here to Eupsilobiinae. The lectotype of Evolocera championi is
   designated here. The history of classification and the known aspects of
   the biology of the subfamily are provided.
   The genus Polymus Mulsant, 1846 is treated here as incertae sedis, due
   to the unavailability of material for study.}},

Abstract = {{The echimyid rodents are the most diverse group of Neotropical
   hystricognaths, with approximately 40 extant and fossil genera.
   Craniodental characters are proposed in order to formulate hypotheses of
   phylogenetic relationships within the Echimyidae. A data matrix of 54
   taxa and 50 characters is constructed and submitted to parsimony
   analyses using PAUP and WinClada programs. Analysis of the complete data
   set results in 47 448 most parsimonious trees 107 steps long. These
   trees are summarized in a strict consensus tree, which is taken as the
   main phylogenetic hypothesis resulting from this study. The monophyly of
   several currently recognized supraspecific taxa is not corroborated.
   These are: the subfamilies Eumysopinae, Echimyinae, Myocastorinae and
   Adelphomyinae; and the genera Proechimys, Echimys and Makalata.
   Conversely, the monophyly of Dactylomyinae and Trinomys is supported.
   New associations are proposed: (1) a clade comprising the extant
   Carterodon, Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys and the fossil Pampamys and
   Theridomysops placed at the base of the crown-group Echimyidae; (2) a
   clade uniting Proechimys, Hoplomys and Trinomys, which is the
   sister-taxon of (3) a clade including Mesomys, Lonchothrix, Myocastor
   and a clade with extant dactylomyines and echimyines and associated
   fossil taxa. Based on this phylogenetic hypothesis, patterns of tooth
   evolution in Echimyidae are discussed, and minimum ages for the
   divergence events within the family are estimated. (C) 2004 The Linnean

Abstract = {{A parsimony analysis of areas of endemism for the monophyletic genus
   Gyriosomus, an eremic and endemic element of the northern coast of
   Chile, was performed. We tested that: (i) distributional patterns of
   Gyriosomus species are determined by environmental heterogeneity, and
   that (ii) discontinuities in the distribution of Gyriosomus species will
   reflect areas of endemism. We identified areas of endemism for
   Gyriosomus species, relating them with vegetational formations, and
   establishing biogeographical patterns among different ecosystems from
   northern Chile. The study area corresponded with the distributional
   limits of the genus from where data on the presence or absence of 34
   species in grid cells half degree longitude by one quarter degree were
   registered on a matrix. The analysis was undertaken using NONA 2.0 and
   Winclada softwares. A strict consensus tree allowed us to establish a
   pattern of nested areas for Gyriosomus, where two areas of endemism were
   recognized; coastal ecosystems of Paposo and Carrizal Bajo. Taltal
   coastal desert was determined for G. angustus and G. curtisi and the
   Huasco coastal desert with G. planalus and G. kingi. The Huasco coastal
   desert followed by the coastal steppe shrub ecosystems were the richest
   areas in terms of Gyriosomus species. A cladogram revealed disjunction
   of faunistic components in two biogeographic units: the coastal desert
   and the steppe shrub, although several species are widely distributed
   along the intermediate depression. The results of this study along with
   a phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus might explain vicariant
   events behind the biogeographic disjunction of Gyriosomus.}},
